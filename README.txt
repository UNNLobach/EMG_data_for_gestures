EMG Pattern Database

For recording patterns, we used a MYO Thalmic bracelet worn on a user’s forearm, and a PC with a Bluetooth receiver. The bracelet is equipped with eight sensors equally spaced around the forearm that simultaneously acquire myographic signals. The signals are sent through a Bluetooth interface to a PC. 
We present raw EMG data for 36 subjects while they performed series of static hand gestures.The subject performs two series, each of which consists of six (seven) basic gestures. Each gesture was performed for 3 seconds with a pause of 3 seconds between gestures.


Description of raw_data _*** file
Each file consist of 10 columns:
1) Time - time in ms;
2-9) Channel - eightEMG channels of MYO Thalmic bracelet;
10) Class  –thelabel of gestures: 
0 - unmarked data,
1 - hand at rest, 
2 - hand clenched in a fist, 
3 - wrist flexion,
4 – wrist extension,
5 – radial deviations,
6 - ulnar deviations,
7 - extended palm (the gesture was not performed by all subjects).
