For experimental assessment of an sEMG-interface, it was developed a hardware–software complex called MyoCursor. The system consists of a MYO Thalmic bracelet worn on a user’s forearm, and a PC with a Bluetooth  receiver running specially designed software. The bracelet is equipped with eight sensors equally spaced around the forearm  that simultaneously acquire myographic signals. The signals are sent through a Bluetooth  interface to a PC. It was used the MYO software development kit to access raw eight-channel data, while the built-in software of the bracelet was disabled. Acquired signals are processed by MyoCursor software v1.12 in real-time. The software recognizes hand gestures and estimates the muscle effort that finally are used for controlling a game module. In the attached zip-file, we present data for 36 tested persons.
To control pacman, it was selected the following six hand gestures as basic motor patterns:G0, hand at rest, was used for  relaxation and elimination of a constant trend; G1 and G2, wrist flexion and extension, imitated movements to the left and to the right, respectively; and G3 and G4, radial and ulnar deviations, simulated up and down movements,respectively. We also used G9, hand clenched in a fist for simulation of the mouse-left click; and some people also performed G10 gestures, extended palm (fingers either together or separately) forimitation of the mouse-right click.
